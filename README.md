# My-own-language
This is my own language. It is developing rapidly.
I call my language Panlish. It has many advantages. For example, it has no complicated changes. Words are regular. According to grammar rules, you can create your own vocabulary and others can understand it.
This is a very creative and bold idea. Many people have started this attempt, and I am one of them. I hope to create a language that is easy to understand, easy to learn and easy to use.
Therefore, there must be many shortcomings, and I hope you can give me some useful suggestions.
